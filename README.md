# Gym Members Fitness Analysis: Linear Regression & Post-Hoc Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of gym members' fitness data, focusing on identifying key predictors of fat percentage using **linear regression** and **post-hoc statistical testing**. The project explores how demographic and behavioral factors, such as workout type, frequency, and experience level, influence body composition.

## Project Overview
- **Data Cleaning**: Ensures data accuracy by handling missing values and duplicates.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes distributions across gender, age, workout type, and more.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Uses linear regression to identify top predictors of fat percentage.
- **Statistical Testing**: Includes Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests to evaluate differences across experience levels.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is available on Kaggle: [Gym Exercise Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrslvarezpea/gym-excersise).

## Key Findings
- **Top Predictors**: Experience Level, Water Intake, Session Duration, Calories Burned, and Workout Frequency strongly influence fat percentage.
- **Significant Differences**: Advanced members have lower fat percentages compared to beginners and intermediates.
- **Gender Insights**: While both genders participate in varied workouts, females tend to have higher fat percentages.

## Repository Structure
- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks with the full analysis, code, and visualizations.
- **data/**: Dataset files or links to data sources.
- **README.md**: Project overview and usage instructions.
